# About the blog
I started this blog to figure out static web programming. It is a record of hobbies, programming, and interests. I'm admittedly also using it as a data dump for workflows that I suspect SOMEONE out there might find useful!

If you want to see some of the places me and my wife see, check out our Instagram page [here](https://www.instagram.com/earl.n.affogato?igsh=NmV3YWdzYjc5bWNk)!

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.5;">
I have a good deal of experience as a wet-lab bench scientist in molecular biology, with a range of multi-disciplinary experience! I've worked on automation, NGS, and assay development. Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:snt.scouting879@passmail.com">snt.scouting879@passmail.com</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.5;">
Graduated from National University of Singapore with an M.Sc in Molecular Biology and from Stony Brook University with a B.Sc. I've picked up R, Python, and Bash.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.5;">
I've been trained as a wet-lab scientist first, and have worked on everything from automation solutions, R&D and GMP efforts on Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, and a NGS CRISPR-KO screen.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.5;">
My interests in biology started with a fascination in ants! I ran across <i>Oecophylla smaragdina</i> and <i>Paratrechina longicornis</i> all the time in Singapore, not forgetting all the other kinds of insects. From there, it grew into a fascination into the cellular mechanisms of the body, and into a desire to add to healthcare as an industry. I still have my interests in the creepy-crawlies, and look for chances to be on the water when I can. More often, my nose is in a book.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.5;">
In my spare time, I mess with whatever catches my fancy; reading, piano, or cooking. I recently moved to South Boston, and taking the opportunity to enjoy MFA, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Boston Public Central Library!

## My Book Recommendations From The Last Year
I plan to add this soon, but I've got an Obsidian based system of tracking my books! I'm hoping to integrate this approach to generate a list of recommendations into Hugo. It seems simple enough to get something up, but I'm hoping to integrate this system into Obsidian as much as possible.

For now, I'll say that the three books I've finished recently and can recommend are:

        <p><em>by Ray Dalio</em></p>
        <p>I've been reading on how to be successful, and the advice from Steven Covey to Charles Duhigg is Principles. This is a great book to begin your journey on this matter!</p>

        <p><em>by Anthony Doerr</em></p>
        <p>An intertwining story covering 5 different people at 5 different times in world history. The singular thread connecting them is an incredible tragedy unique to each, and a story by the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes: Cloud Cuckoo Land.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/inferno/dante/robin-kirkpatrick/9780141393544">Robin Kirkpatrick's translation of the Divine Comedy</a></h3>
        <p><em>by Dante (translated by Robin Kirkpatrick)</em></p>
        <p>A lovely translation that focuses on carrying over the meaning, but sacrifices some of the lyricism that Dante is known for. If you want an introduction to Dante, this is a great book!</p>

# My Papers (last updated 19th Jan, 2020)

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li><a href="https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/162732">NUS Thesis: Pathway Mechanisms For Cancer Cell Migration Through CRISPR-KO And scRNA-Seq</a></li>
	<p style="margin-left:2em;">
	Genome-wide loss of function (LOF) screens via siRNA knockdown or CRISPR-knockout (CRISPR-KO) have successfully identified genes required for cancer cell viability. Most cancer fatalities, however, are from metastases, and it would be extremely valuable to identify genetic markers that contribute to tumour metastasis.... (CONTINUED IN PAPER)
