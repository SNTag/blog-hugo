# About the blog

I started this blog to figure out static web programming. It was to be a record of hobbies, programming, 
and interests, but I've admittedly started using it as a data dump for workflows that I suspect SOMEONE 
out there might find useful!

<p>
I have a good deal of experience as a wet-lab bench scientist in molecular biology, with a range of multi-disciplinary experience! I've worked on automation, NGS, and assay development. Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:snt.scouting879@passmail.com">snt.scouting879@passmail.com</a>.

<p>
Graduated from National University of Singapore with an M.Sc in Molecular Biology and Stony Brook University with a B.Sc. I've picked up R, Python, and Bash.
</p>

<p>
My studies have covered a relatively broad spectrum of biology.  My most recent project was to develop an approach to using a CRISPR-KO library with a migration assay, as can be read in my first post.

<p>
In my spare time, I mess with whatever catches my fancy; reading, piano, or cooking.

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">
	Genome-wide loss of function (LOF) screens via siRNA knockdown or CRISPR-knockout (CRISPR-KO) have successfully identified genes required for cancer cell viability. Most cancer fatalities, however, are from metastases, and it would be extremely valuable to identify genetic markers that contribute to tumour metastasis.... (CONTINUED IN PAPER)
