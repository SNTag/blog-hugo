Way I see it, I'm not using this blog as often to write posts or plan to upload
to github. But I still want to contribute to this global information network.
I'm going to try something new by instead linking some of my notes on a project
or two. I won't claim to update, upkeep, or upload everything. At the very
least, it will give me a public way to access my own notes on a project if I
need it.
