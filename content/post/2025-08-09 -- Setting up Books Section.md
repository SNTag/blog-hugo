# My Book Recommendations From The Last Year
I'm working on a new section for my blog. I've been creating a digital library with my reviews and comments using Obsidian. For the fun of it, I've been adapting this information over time to add to this blog. Only thing left is to add this information to the blog website!

To access this growing section, see the Header section: "Books".

Obsidian Bases has been an incredible way to sort through my notes. I wouldn't recommend Obsidian for everyone unless you are somewhat Tech Literacy, but it has enabled my system in a way that I'm surprised.

For now, I'll say that the three books I've finished recently and can recommend are:

        <h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/principles-life-and-work-ray-dalio/6696067?ean=9781501124020&next=t">Principles</a></h3>
        <p><em>by Ray Dalio</em></p>
        <p>I've been reading on how to be successful, and the advice from Steven Covey to Charles Duhigg is Principles. This is a great book to begin your journey on this matter!</p>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 15px; margin: 20px 0; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img src="https://images-us.bookshop.org/ingram/9781982168445.jpg" 
         alt="Cloud Cuckoo Land cover" 
         style="width: 150px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; flex-shrink: 0;">
    <div>
        <h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/cloud-cuckoo-land-anthony-doerr/16076948?ean=9781982168445&next=t">Cloud Cuckoo Land</a></h3>
        <p><em>by Anthony Doerr</em></p>
        <p>An intertwining story covering 5 different people at 5 different times in world history. The singular thread connecting them is an incredible tragedy unique to each, and a story by the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes: Cloud Cuckoo Land.</p>

         alt="Divine Comedy cover" 
         style="width: 150px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; flex-shrink: 0;">
    <div>
        <h3><a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/inferno/dante/robin-kirkpatrick/9780141393544">Robin Kirkpatrick's translation of the Divine Comedy</a></h3>
        <p><em>by Dante (translated by Robin Kirkpatrick)</em></p>
        <p>A lovely translation that focuses on carrying over the meaning, but sacrifices some of the lyricism that Dante is known for. If you want an introduction to Dante, this is a great book!</p>
