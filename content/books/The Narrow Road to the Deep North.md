# My Summary
A riveting story during World War II, it follows an Australian soldier interned in a Japanese concentration camp and the hostilities he faced.

Strongly recommended for a tough story of survival and history. The fact that it won the 2014 Man Booker Prize should tell you it's good!

# Bookshop.org Notes
NATIONAL BESTSELLER • MAN BOOKER PRIZE WINNER • A magisterial novel of love and war that traces the life of one man from World War II to the present.

## Summary
August, 1943: Australian surgeon Dorrigo Evans is haunted by his affair with his uncle’s young wife two years earlier. His life, in a brutal Japanese POW camp on the Thai-Burma Death Railway, is a daily struggle to save the men under his command. Until he receives a letter that will change him forever.
  
A savagely beautiful novel about the many forms of good and evil, of truth and transcendence, as one man comes of age, prospers, only to discover all that he has lost.

## Reviews
“Some years, very good books win the Man Booker Prize, but this year a masterpiece has won it.” 
— A.C. Grayling, Chair of Judges, Man Booker Prize 2014

“Richard Flanagan has written a sort of Australian *War and Peace*.” — Alan Cheuse, NPR 

“A symphony of tenderness and love, a moving and powerful story that captures the weight and breadth of a life... A masterpiece.” — The Guardian

“I suspect that on rereading, this magnificent novel will seem even more intricate, more carefully and beautifully constructed.” — New York Times Book Review

"Magnificent." — The New York Times Book Review 

“Captivating... This is a classic work of war fiction from a world-class writer... Nothing since Cormac McCarthy’s *The Road* has shaken me like this.” — Ron Charles, Washington Post 

“Elegantly wrought, measured, and without an ounce of melodrama, Flanagan’s novel is nothing short of a masterpiece.” — Financial Times

"Nothing short of a masterpiece." — Financial Times  

“A moving and necessary work of devastating humanity and lasting significance.” — Seattle Times

“A novel of extraordinary power, deftly told and hugely affecting. A classic in the making.” — The Observer
  
“Nothing could have prepared us for this immense achievement... The Narrow Road to the Deep North is beyond comparison.” — The Australian
  
“A devastatingly beautiful novel.” — The Sunday Times (London)  

“The book Richard Flanagan was born to write.” — The Economist
  
“It is the story of Dorrigo, as one man among many POWs in the Asian jungle, that is the beating heart of this book: an excruciating, terrifying, life-altering story that is an indelible fictional testament to the prisoners there.” — Michiko Kakutani, New York Times

“Exhilarating... Life affirming.” — Sydney Morning Herald
  
“A supple meditation on memory, trauma, and empathy that is also a sublime war novel... Pellucid, epic, and sincerely touching.” — Publishers Weekly

“Homeric... Flanagan’s feel for language, history’s persistent undercurrent, and subtle detail sets his fiction apart. There isn’t a false note in this book.” — Irish Times

“*The Narrow Road to the Deep North* is a big, magnificent novel of passion and horror and tragic irony. Its scope, its themes and its people all seem to grow richer and deeper in significance with the progress of the story, as it moves to its extraordinary resolution. It’s by far the best new novel I’ve read in ages.” — Patrick McGrath, author of Constance  

“I loved this book. Not just a great novel but an important book in its ability to look at terrible things and create something beautiful. Everyone should read it.” — Evie Wyld, author of All the Birds, Singing  
  
“The luminous imagination of Richard Flanagan is among the most precious of Australian literary treasures.” — Newcastle Herald  
  
“In an already sparkling career, this might be his biggest, best, most moving work yet.” — Sunday Age (Melbourne)  

“An unforgettable story of men at war... Flanagan’s prose is richly innovative and captures perfectly the Australian demotic of tough blokes, with their love of nicknames and excellent swearing. He evokes Evans’s affair with Amy, and his subsequent soulless wanderings, with an intensity and beauty that is as poetic as the classical Japanese literature that peppers this novel.” — The Times (London)
  
“Extraordinarily beautiful, intelligent, and sharply insightful... Flanagan handles the horrifyingly grim details of the wartime conditions with lapidary precision and is equally good on the romance of the youthful indiscretion that haunts Evans.” — Booklist
  
“Virtuosic... Flanagan’s book is as harrowing and brutal as it is beautiful and moving... This deeply affecting, elegiac novel will stay with readers long after it’s over.” — Shelf Awareness
  
“Devastating... Flanagan’s father died the day this book was finished. But he would, no doubt, have been as proud of it as his son was of him.” — The Independent (UK)  

“Despite the novel’s epic sprawl it retains the delicate vignettes that characterise Flanagan’s work, those beautiful brush strokes of poignancy and veracity that remain in the reader’s mind long afterwards.” —West Australian News
  
“Mesmerising... A profound meditation on life and time, memory and forgetting... A magnificent achievement, truly the crown on an already illustrious career.” — Adelaide Advertiser
