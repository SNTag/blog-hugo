# My Notes
{{< quote style="elegant" author="Epicurus" >}}
Against other things it is possible to obtain security, but when it comes to death we human beings all live in a unwalled city
{{< /quote >}}


{{< quote style="elegant" author="Philodermus" >}}
Men suffer the worst while for the sake of the most alien desires, they neglect the most necessary appetites. It is impossible to live pleasurably without living prudently and honorably and justly, and also without living courageously and temperately and magnanimously, and without making friends, and without being philanthropic.

## The Swerve

How the World Became Modern by Stephen Greenblatt PH D

In the winter of 1417, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties plucked a very old manuscript off a dusty shelf in a remote monastery, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. He was Poggio Bracciolini, the greatest book hunter of the Renaissance. His discovery, Lucretius' ancient poem *On the Nature of Things,* had been almost entirely lost to history for more than a thousand years.  

It was a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functions without the aid of gods, that religious fear is damaging to human life, that pleasure and virtue are not opposites but intertwined, and that matter is made up of very small material particles in eternal motion, randomly colliding and swerving in new directions. Its return to circulation changed the course of history. The poem's vision would shape the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein, and-in the hands of Thomas Jefferson-leave its trace on the Declaration of Independence.  

From the gardens of the ancient philosophers to the dark chambers of monastic scriptoria during the Middle Ages to the cynical, competitive court of a corrupt and dangerous pope, Greenblatt brings Poggio's search and discovery to life in a way that deepens our understanding of the world we live in now.  

## Review
"An intellectually invigorating, nonfiction version of a Dan Brown-like mystery-in-the-archives thriller." 
â€” *Boston Globe*
