      <description>edit on 06/05/2020: My github repo for this goal will not be as heavily developed going forward. I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on things that are personalized ways of approaching problems (making my own packages, reiterations of previous scripts, just a general mess). Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m working on my github etiquette. I&amp;rsquo;ve been approaching github as a storage repository for nearly any code. I plan to only commit code I am proud of moving forward.</description>

      <description>When I first started using org-mode on Emacs, the agenda option seemed like too much hassle. There was too much programming involved, too many shortcuts to remember (like anything Emacs), and it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t pretty. But mid-2019, most other methods to become organized just didn&amp;rsquo;t click, and org-agenda seemed ever-more appealing. With a little bit of effort (or in my case, copy-paste) in the configuration, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get something that works.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER I assume that you have working knowledge of vectors (plasmids) used in molecular biology, and know what an RNA or sgRNA is. Anything else is not important or will be explained.
My master&amp;rsquo;s thesis will be published soon on the NUS scholar&amp;rsquo;s bank. While I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do, the wet lab side of the work almost broke me! For instance, an image in the thesis showing a western blot of DLG5 Knock-Out (KO) took almost 3 months of work.</description>
