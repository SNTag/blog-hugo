      <description>edit on 06/05/2020: My github repo for this goal will not be as heavily developed going forward. I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on things that are personalized ways of approaching problems (making my own packages, reiterations of previous scripts, just a general mess). Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m working on my github etiquette. I&amp;rsquo;ve been approaching github as a storage repository for nearly any code. I plan to only commit code I am proud of moving forward.</description>
