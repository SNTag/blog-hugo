<h1>About the blog</h1>

<p>
This blog will be a record of projects completed both professionally and in my spare time.  Beyond that, it will be about programming, history, and a little bit of life.  I started this blog out of a project to figure out static web programming.  It's a little something that's still developing into something else.

<h1> About me </h1>
</center>

<IMG align="left" SRC="/images/profile/profile.png" ALT="my profile" width="315"> <p> Graduated from National University of Singapore with an M.Sc in Molecular Biology and Stony Brook University with a B.Sc.  I am increasingly fond of programming, and picked up Python, Bash, and R.
</p>

<p>
My studies have covered a relatively broad spectrum of biology.  My most recent project was to develop an approach to using a CRISPR-KO library with a migration assay, as can be read in my first post.

<p>
In my spare time, I mess with whatever catches my fancy; reading, piano, tech, or my camera.  More often than not, I'm on my computer trying to find new ways of wrecking my system.

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">
	Genome-wide loss of function (LOF) screens via siRNA knockdown or CRISPR-knockout (CRISPR-KO) have successfully identified genes required for cancer cell viability. Most cancer fatalities, however, are from metastases, and it would be extremely valuable to identify genetic markers that contribute to tumour metastasis.... (CONTINUED IN PAPER)
