Way I see it, I'm not using this blog as often to write posts or plan to upload
to github. But I still want to contribute to this global information network.
I'm going to try something new by instead linking some of my notes on a project
or two. These are general documents that help me when I'm working on a project.
If you need a quick way to find them, see the new menu option above for
'makers'.

I won't claim to update, upkeep, or upload everything. At the very least, it
will give me a public way to access my own notes if I need it.

Sort of posts I plan to add under the makers menu:
- How I generate beamer/pdfs using pandoc and a makefile.
- Notes and reminders to myself on using various machines at Lowell Makes (CNC,
  3d printer, etc)
- Notes on customzing this blog (?)

Projects or posts that I plan to share would still be found only on the main
page.
